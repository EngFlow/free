# EngFlow Free Tier

EngFlow Free Tier is a single-node, standalone version of the [EngFlow
platform](https://www.engflow.com) that implements a remote cache, remote
execution service, and build web UI for [Remote Execution
v2](https://github.com/bazelbuild/remote-apis/blob/main/build/bazel/remote/execution/v2/remote_execution.proto)
protocol clients such as [Bazel](https://bazel.build).

EngFlow Free Tier may be used a remote cache and UI for any Bazel build. It can
also execute remote actions in a Linux Docker container.

## Getting started

EngFlow Free Tier is distributed as a Docker image for x86_64 Linux. The images
are hosted by the [GitHub container
registry](https://github.com/EngFlow/free/pkgs/container/free). Run the
following to start up a EngFlow Free Tier instance that stores its data in
`/tmp/engflow_data`:

    $ docker run --init --rm --mount=type=bind,src=/var/run/docker.sock,dst=/var/run/docker.sock -v /tmp/engflow_data:/tmp/engflow_data -e DATA_DIR=/tmp/engflow_data -p 8080:8080 ghcr.io/engflow/free:2.8.0

Once EngFlow starts up, it will print configuration hints for Bazel.  Try it out
as a remote executor on your own Bazel project or on the [EngFlow example
repository](https://github.com/engflow/example):

    $ git clone https://github.com/engflow/example engflow-example
    $ cd engflow-example
    $ bazel test --config engflow --bes_results_url=http://127.0.0.1:8080/invocation/ --bes_backend=grpc://127.0.0.1:8080 --remote_executor=grpc://127.0.0.1:8080 //java/...

Bazel should print a URL to view the EngFlow build UI for the build in a web
browser.

EngFlow requires a Docker image to execute remote actions in. The EngFlow
example repository configures the image using the `rbe_autoconfig` workspace
rule from
[bazel-toolchains](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel-toolchains). For simple
usecases, an image may be passed via Bazel's `--remote_default_exec_properties`
flag. For instance,
`--remote_default_exec_properties=container-image=docker://docker.io/ubuntu:focal-20210827`
to run remote actions in a recent Ubuntu container.

## Configuration

EngFlow stores its caches and logs in the location pointed to by the `$DATA_DIR`
environmental variable. Mount this location onto the host to preserve data
across container invocations and view the service logs. If remote execution is
used, `$DATA_DIR` must have the same path on the host and in the
container. Additionally, the Docker Unix socket must be mounted into the
container to allow EngFlow to execute actions in Docker containers.

The size of disk dedicated to the CAS will be automatically calculated; it may
be manually specified with the `--disk_size` flag.

The `--default_replicate_timeout` flag should be set to twice the longest build
time to ensure the garbage collector can work efficiently to reclaim disk
space. It defaults to 24 hours.
